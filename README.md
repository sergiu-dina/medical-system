# Medical System

This application is a web application for managing a medical office and it was built as a university project.

The app was built with C# using ASP.NET Core, MVC, Entity Framework Core and Identity Core. The front end was developed with HTML, JavaScript and Bootstrap. The database was built with SQL Server.

## General Description

The app's interface allows users to perform CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the main entities of the app. A role based security system was implemented to create permission based roles. The roles of Admin and Client restrict what the user can see and do.
